# Ransomware Simulation Tool - Week 11

## 📋 Overview

This is an educational ransomware simulation tool developed as part of a cybersecurity internship. The tool demonstrates how ransomware operates by encrypting and decrypting files in a controlled, safe environment.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This tool is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand ransomware attack patterns and behavior
- Learn about file encryption and cryptographic operations
- Develop security awareness and incident response knowledge
- Demonstrate technical capabilities in a cybersecurity context

## 🔧 Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Safe Simulation Mode**: Creates encrypted copies without destroying originals
- ✅ **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses Fernet (AES-128) for file encryption
- ✅ **Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage
- ✅ **File Scanning**: Intelligent file targeting with safety exclusions
- ✅ **Logging System**: Comprehensive activity tracking and audit trails
- ✅ **Recovery Mode**: Complete decryption and file restoration
- ✅ **Analysis Reports**: Detailed technical and statistical reports

### Safety Mechanisms
- Default simulation mode (non-destructive)
- Protected file type exclusions (.exe, .dll, .sys, .py)
- Test directory creation with sample files
- Confirmation required for real mode
- Comprehensive error handling

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Required Packages**
   ```powershell
   pip install cryptography
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**
   ```powershell
   python --version
   pip list | Select-String cryptography
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Commands

#### 1. Complete Demo (Recommended for First Run)
```powershell
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode demo
```
This runs a full demonstration: encryption → ransom note → decryption → analysis

#### 2. Encryption Simulation
```powershell
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode encrypt
```

#### 3. Decryption Recovery
```powershell
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode decrypt --key "Week 11/encryption_key_XXXXXXXX.key"
```

#### 4. Generate Analysis Report
```powershell
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode analyze
```

#### 5. Custom Target Directory
```powershell
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode encrypt --target "Week 11/CustomTest"
```

### Advanced Options

```powershell
# View all available options
python "Ransomare tool.py" --help

# Real mode (DANGEROUS - not recommended)
python "Ransomare tool.py" --mode encrypt --real-mode
```

## 📊 Output Files

After running the tool, you'll find the following files in the `Week 11/` directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `encryption_key_XXXXXXXX.key` | Encryption key for recovery |
| `attack_report_XXXXXXXX.json` | Detailed JSON attack statistics |
| `analysis_report_XXXXXXXX.txt` | Comprehensive analysis report |
| `Logs/ransomware_sim_XXXXXXXX.log` | Complete activity log |
| `TestFiles/` | Sample files for simulation |
| `TestFiles/RANSOM_NOTE.txt` | Simulated ransom note |

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Encryption Algorithm
- **Algorithm**: Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Cipher**: AES-128-CBC with HMAC authentication
- **Implementation**: Python `cryptography` library

### Attack Chain Phases
1. **Reconnaissance**: Scan target directory for vulnerable files
2. **Key Generation**: Create strong encryption key
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt files with progress tracking
4. **Notification**: Deploy ransom note
5. **Logging**: Record all activities

### File Flow
```
Original File → Scan → Encrypt → .encrypted → Decrypt → Restored File
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### What This Tool Demonstrates
- How ransomware encrypts files
