## 🔥 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this tool dangerous?**
A: No—default simulation mode creates encrypted copies without destroying originals. Multiple safety features prevent accidents.

**Q: How is this different from real ransomware?**
A: Real ransomware destroys data permanently, spreads across networks, and demands payment. This is educational, controlled, and reversible.

**Q: What did you learn?**
A: Cryptography implementation, attack patterns, importance of backups, defensive strategies, and ethical security practices.

**Q: Could this be used maliciously?**
A: The tool is designed with safety features and ethical use in mind. It requires explicit user action and includes comprehensive logging.

**Q: What's the practical value?**
A: Security awareness training, understanding attack patterns, practicing incident response, and appreciating defensive measures.
